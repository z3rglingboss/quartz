Suggested Teaching Order

Jukin’ in closed > Basic in closed > in open > Follows inside turn > (Lead’s belt turn)

  

- Start with a syllabus “Today, we’re going to learn a bit of basic swing. Here’s a quick demo” 15-30 seconds
    
- Teach closed position. Play some slow swing.
    

- Swing dancing is just doing what the music asks you to do, if the music asks you to slow dance you do it. You already know how wow!
    
- This is perfect for any slower song, because then you can chitchat.
    
- BONUS Tenet Number 1: When you turn, turn underneath your hands
    

- Teach an inside turn in slow dancing
    

- Teach 6-count in open. Play some medium swing.
    

- Count “Rock Step, Groove, Groove”
    

- Since the song is faster, we fill in the space a bit more with this pattern. (Maybe a triple step, but probably not)
    

- Teach then dance between closed and open for the rest of the song
    

- Teach 6-count transition into closed
    
- Dance a song in 6-count, transitioning between open and closed.
    
- Introduce or Reiterate Tenet Number 1: When you turn, you turn underneath your hands
    

- To help this, Leaders have to put your hands across and draw a halo.
    
- Things that can help Leaders: “Check Your Watch” “Draw a Halo” “Start the turn, then she finishes it”
    
- Things that can help Follows: “You finish the turn” “Turn slowly, and make him catch up” “Keep on dancing!”
    

  

Final Notes

- Try to teach-by-dancing. Dance with the attendees after the lesson lead/backlead-as-a-follow to teach shape.
    
- Couples will be slower to learn than individual dancers. Be patient.
    
- Say the rhythm out loud as much as you can.
    
- Encourage them to come back again after dancing for the first time.
    
- Wait, Don’t forget to have fun. That. It’s cool. It’s a non-profit!**
