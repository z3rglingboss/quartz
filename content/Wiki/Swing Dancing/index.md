The primary style of swing that I dance is Lindy Hop. These are topics that are related to swing dance in some form. Subtopics include pedagogy, style, music, and history. Also consider checking out my [[Blog/Lindyhopdiaries Archive/index|Lindy Hop Blog]] archive from back in 2013.

Swing dancing is one of my [[Five Hobbies]].
