title: Welcome to J.Win's awesome website
---

This is a blank Quartz installation. Home Page.


A Few Sections to get you started:
- My [[Blog/index|Blog]] is currently where I hope to post my public notes and thoughts in a stream-of-thought or narrative format.  There, you can also find the [[Blog/Lindyhopdiaries Archive/index|archives]] of my Lindy Hop Blog that I tried to start in 2013.
- [[Wiki/Swing Dancing/index|Swing Dancing]] topics are converted notes and lesson plans I've taken over the years. Some notes are only a few months old, others I originally drafted in 2014 or so.
- 

How does this home page even work? lol.
See the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to get started.
