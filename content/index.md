title: Welcome to J.Win's awesome website

Hello! My name is Justin Nguyen, and welcome to my digital garden. I created this as a repository of my ideas, dogmas, and silly theories as a way to document my personal [memes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) 


A Few Sections to get you started:
- My [[Blog/index|Blog]] is currently where I hope to post my public notes and thoughts in a stream-of-thought or narrative format.  There, you can also find the [[Blog/Lindyhopdiaries Archive/index|archives]] of my Lindy Hop Blog that I tried to start in 2013.
- [[Wiki/Swing Dancing/index|Swing Dancing]] topics are converted notes and lesson plans I've taken over the years. Some notes are only a few months old, others I originally drafted in 2014 or so.
- Most importantly, my [garden](Garden/index.md) is where I hope to plant and tend ideas to possibly develop them into permanent things in my [wiki](Wiki/index.md).
