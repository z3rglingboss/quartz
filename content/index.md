title: Welcome to J.Win's awesome website

This is a blank Quartz installation. Home Page.


A Few Sections to get you started:
- [[Wiki/Swing Dancing/index|Swing Dancing]] topics are converted notes and lesson plans i've taken over the years. Some notes are only a few months old, others I originally drafted in 2014 or so.

How does this home page even work? lol.
See the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to get started.
